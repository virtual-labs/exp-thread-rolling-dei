    {
      "question": "In which type of thread rolling operation, the billet rotates as well as revolves also:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "in two rolls with guide system",
        "b": "in flat dies system",
        "c": "in three rolls system",
        "d": "in planetary dies system"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Billet rotates but does not revolve.",
        "b": "Flat dies cause rolling only.",
        "c": "Three roll systems cause rotation only.",
        "d": "Planetary dies cause both rotation and revolution."

      "question": "The following is not an advantage of thread rolling process over thread cutting process:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "quality of cold rolled products are good",

      "question": "When considering the blank diameter tolerance, a change in blank diameter will affect the major diameter by an approximate ratio of 5 to 1:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "True",
        "b": "False",
        "c": "Can't say"

      "question": "A rolled thread can often be easily recognized because the thread has a smaller diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made:",

        "a": "Rolled threads have larger diameter than the blank.",
