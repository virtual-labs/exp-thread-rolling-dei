      "question": "For what type of material does these threading techniques can be made possible:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Ductile material",
        "b": "Brittle material",
        "c": "Harder material",
        "d": "Tougher material"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Thread rolling requires plastic deformation, hence ductile materials are suitable.",
        "b": "Brittle materials cannot undergo plastic flow.",
        "c": "Hardness alone is not sufficient.",
        "d": "Toughness is not the deciding factor."

        "a": "Yield strength improves due to cold working.",
        "b": "Hardness increases due to strain hardening.",
        "c": "Resilience is not improved by thread rolling.",
