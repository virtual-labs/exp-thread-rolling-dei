### Procedure


1. Start the thread rolling setup or simulation and ensure that the machine and dies are in proper working condition.

2. Select a suitable ductile material for the thread blank, such as mild steel or aluminium.

3. Choose the appropriate thread rolling method based on the application, such as flat dies, two-die cylindrical, three-die cylindrical, or planetary dies.

4. Set the required thread specifications, including pitch, thread angle, and length of the threaded portion.

5. Adjust the die alignment and ensure correct positioning of the thread blank between the dies.

6. Set the rolling speed and feed rate according to the material and thread size.

7. Initiate the thread rolling operation, allowing the blank to rotate and deform plastically between the dies.

8. Observe the flow of material into the thread profile and ensure proper formation of threads without surface defects.

9. Continue the operation until the desired thread depth and profile are achieved.

10. Stop the process and inspect the rolled threads for dimensional accuracy, surface finish, and overall quality.
