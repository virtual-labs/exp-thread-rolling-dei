### About the Experiment 

Thread rolling is used to produce threads in substantial quantities. This is a cold-forming process operation in which the threads are formed by rolling a thread blank between hardened dies that cause the metal to flow radially into the desired shape. Because no metal is removed in the form of chips, less material is required, resulting in substantial savings. In addition, because of cold working, the threads have greater strength than cut threads, and a smoother, harder and more wear resistant surface is obtained. In addition, the process is fast, with production rates of one per second being common. The quality of cold rolled products is consistently good. Chip-less operations are cleaner and there is a savings in material.
